However, I decided to choose the option to finalize the course project.
Because the individual task seemed to me too narrow in execution. I also had problems with accounting for rejected materials and production.

List of changes:
1. The database is developed in a new project with some modifications compared to the previous project
2. The real production strategy was taken into account as I was able to find an information mentor
3. The data in the EXCEL document was corrected. They now have a more logical relationship between data and tables
4. The data output screen has been improved. Now it has become more informative


What remains unfinished:
1. The data entry screen has not been created, as for me it presents some difficulty in practice. In theory I understand what needs to be done and I can even imagine the end result, but in practice it's more complicated.
